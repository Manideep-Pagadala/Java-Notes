1) What is a programming language

2) What is Technology

3) What is Framework


=======================
Programming Language
=======================

=> Language is a medium to communicate

		1) Human Languages

			Ex: English, Hindi, Telugu

		2) Programming Languages

			Ex: C, C++, Java, Python, C#


=> Programming Languages are used to communicate with Computer	

=> Every P.L contains set of syntaxes and rules		

=> Using P.L we can develop software applications

Note: Java is a programming language.

======================
Software Technologies
======================

-> Technologies are developed based on progrmming languages only

	Ex: Servlets, JSP

-> Technogies are used to develop different types of applications

-> We need to write duplicate code in project at serveral places

	Ex :

		1) get connection
		2) create stmt
		3) execute query
		4) process results
		5) capture form data
		6) validate form data
		7) convert form data to DTO obj


100 Database tables

100 DAO classes

In every DAO we have 10 methods

100 * 10 => 1000 methods


2 Types of logics

		1) Common Logics  

		2) Business Logics 


	Challenges : 

			1) Duplicate Code (Boiler Plate Code)
			2) More lines of code
			3) More  Exceptions
			4) Maintenence		

==============
Frameworks		
==============

-> It is a piece of software (semi developed software)

-> Framework provides common logics required for application development

-> Using frameworks we can develop applications quickly

-> If we are using frameworks then we need to focus only on  business logics.

		1) no duplicate code
		2) faster development
		3) less lines of code
		4) less no of bugs
		5) easy maintenence

Session - 03 (06-Nov)
######################

==========================
Layered Architecture
=========================

1) Presentation Layer   : User interface

	Technologies : JSP / Angular / React / Vue JS

2) Web Layer : Controllers (Handles request & response)

	Technologies : Servlets / Struts framework	

3) Business Layer : Services (business logic)


4) Persistence Layer : DAO classes (DB communication)

		Technologies : JDBC / Hibernate framework

=============================
What is Spring Framework ?
=============================

-> Spring is an application development framework

-> Spring provides support for end to end application development

-> Spring is java based framework

-> Spring is free of cost

-> Spring released in the year of 2004 (1.x)

-> The current  version of spring is 6.x (2022)

=====================
Spring Architecture
=====================

-> Spring framework developed in modular fashion

-> Spring Modules are loosely copuled (independent)

-> We have several modules in spring framework like below


1) Spring Core

2) Spring Context

3) Spring AOP

4) Spring JDBC / Spring DAO

5) Spring ORM

6) Spring Web MVC

7) Spring REST

8) Spring Security

9) Spring Batch

10) Spring Cloud

11) Spring Data .....


Note: We can use any module based on our project requirement.

=============
Spring Core
=============

-> It is base module in the spring framework

-> It is providing fundamental concepts of spring

		1) IOC Container
		2) Dependency Injection
		3) Auto wiring

Note: Using spring core we can develop application classes with loosely coupling.

================
Spring Context
================

-> It is responsible for managing configurations in the application.

==============
Spring AOP
==============

AOP : Aspect Oriented Programming

=> AOP is used to seperate primary logics and secondary logics in the application.

		Primary Logic : Business logic

			Ex: amt-deposit, amt-withdra, balance check

		Secondary logic : cross-cutting logics (helper logics)

			Ex: security, tx, logging, auditing etc...

===================
Spring JDBC	/ DAO
===================

-> It is used to develop persistence layer in the application.

-> Using Spring JDBC we can avoid boiler plate code.


		Register Driver : Spring jdbc will handle

		Get connection : Spring jdbc will handle

		Create Stmt : Spring jdbc will handle

		execute query  : Programmer should handle

		process result : spring jdbc will handle

		close connection : spring jdbc will handle


Note: Spring JDBC module internally will communicate with JDBC API.

===========
Spring ORM 
============

=> ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping

=> ORM will represent data in the form of Objects

=> Hibernate is called as ORM framework

=> Hibernate is used to develop persistence layer

=> Spring ORM developed on top of Hibernate.

=> Using Spring ORM we can avoid boiler plate code in DAO layer.


================
Spring Web MVC
================

=> It is used to develop web application with MVC architecture

=> It supports web layer + presentation layer development.

=> It is used to develop C2B applications

		(Customer to business)

=> It supports multiple presentation technologies

			1) JSP
			2) Thymeleaf


=============
Spring REST
=============

=> It is used to develop distributed applications (B2B)

=> One app can communicate with another application


	passport <===========>  aadhar app

	makeymytrip <===========> irctc

	gpay <============> bank app

================
Spring Security
================

=> We can secure our application using Spring Security


1) Authentication : Who can access our app

2) Authorization : Role Based Access

=============
Spring Batch
=============

=> Batch operation means bulk operation

=> To implement bulk operations we will use spring batch


1) sending bulk sms to all students
2) geneate bank stmt for all account holders
3) send credit bill for all card holder

==============
Spring Cloud
==============

=> It is used to implement microservices


1) Service Registry
2) API Gateway
3) FeignClient
4) Circuit Breaker etc...




1) What is Framework

2) Advantages with framework

3) Struts Framework

4) Hibernate Framework

5) Layered Architecture

6) Spring Framework

7) Spring Architecture

8) Spring Modules

=> Project contains multiple classes

		a) Controllers : To handle req & res

		b) Services : Business logic

		c) DAOs : Persistence logic


=> Controller class methods should call service class methods

		(controllers are dependent on services)	


=> service class methods should call DAO class methods

		(services are dependent on DAOs)

==================================================================
How one java class method can access another java class method	
==================================================================

1) By Inheritence (IS-A)

2) By Composition (HAS-A)	

===============
IS-A Relation
================

public class Engine {
	
	public int start() {
		System.out.println("Engine Starting...");
		return 1;
	}

}

public class Car extends Engine {

	public void drive() {
		int status = super.start();

		if (status >= 1) {
			System.out.println("Journey Started...");
		} else {
			System.out.println("Failed to start the engine...");
		}
	}
}

==================
HAS-A relation
==================

public class Car  {
	public void drive() {
		
		Engine eng = new Engine();
		int status = eng.start();
		
		if (status >= 1) {
			System.out.println("Journey Started...");
		} else {
			System.out.println("Failed to start the engine...");
		}
	}
}

=============
Conclusion
=============

=> With IS-A & HAS-A relation our classes are tightly coupled.


=> Developing classs with tighlty coupling not recommended.

=> Always we need to develop our classes with loosely coupling.

=> To develop classes with loosely coupling we will use Spring Core module.



=============
Spring Core
==============

-> It is base module in spring framework

-> Core module providing fundamental concepts of spring

		1) IOC container (IOC)
		2) Dependency Injection (DI)
		4) Autowiring 


=> By  using spring core concepts we can develop classs with loosely coupling.

=> If we want our classes to be managed by IOC then we need to develop our classes with some rules.

=========================
Strategy Design Pattern
=========================

1) Favour composition over inheritence

2) Code with Interfaces instead of implementation classes

3) Code should be open for extension and closed for modification


========================
Constructor Injection
========================

=> Inject one class object into another class obj using constructor.

	Ex : Car c = new Car(new PetrolEng());


========================
setter Injection
========================

=> Injecting one class object into another class object using setter method 



		Ex:   Car c = new Car();
			 c.setEng(new DieselEng());





Q) If we perform both CI & SI then what will happen ?

Ans) 

CI will happen first at the time of obj creation

Afte CI, SI will happen

SI will override CI

So the final value will be SI injected value/obj.






=====================
Dependency Injection
=====================

=> The process of injecting dependent object into target object is called as dependency injection.

		
		Car is dependent on Engine

		Controller is dependent on Service

		Service is dependent on DAO

=> We can perform Dependency Injection in 3 ways

		1) Constructor Injection
		2) Setter Injection
		3) Field Injection		


Requirement: Develop BillPayment application usin Strategy Design Pattern.

	1) Cash  (device not required)
	2) Scanner
	3) Debit Card
	4) Credit Card



=====================================
IOC Container (Inversion Of Control)
=====================================

=> IOC is a principle which is responsible to manage and colloborate dependencies among the objects in the application.

=> IOC will take care of Dependency Injection

=> It will create dependent object and target object and then it will inject dependent obj into target object.

====================
What is Spring Bean
====================

=> The java classes which are managed by IOC are called as Spring Bean classes.



=========
Maven
=========

=> Maven is a build tool for java applications

=> Maven developed by Apache Org

=> Maven s/w developed by using Java language

=> Maven is free & OSS

=> Using Maven we can create both stand-alone & web apps.


#### Maven Setup  :: https://youtu.be/hV1OWzYpzxo?si=jD7vz3oJeRVclTxF

###########  Note: Alternate for maven is Gradle. ##############

### Gradle Tutorial : https://youtu.be/I84f9Q5bFBA?si=8qs3Ue7N_E0bBQco

========================
Creating Maven Project
========================

-> We can create maven project using CLI & IDE


-> Select File -> New -> Maven Project

			- Select simple project (stand-alone)

			- groupId : in.ashokit

			- artifactId : 01-Spring-IOC-App

			- packaging : jar

			- Click on Finish


=> Once project created we can see below folder structure

		- src/main/java  (source code we will keep here)

		- src/main/resources  (config files we will keep here)

		- src/test/java (junit classes for unit testing)

		- src/test/resources (junit related config files)

		- target (.class files will be stored here)

		- Maven Dependencies (downloaded jars/dependencies)

		- pom.xml (maven config file)



=> We can search for maven dependencies using www.mvnrepository.com

=============
Bean Scopes
=============

=> Bean Scope will decide how many objects should be created for spring bean class.

=> We have 4 types of scopes

		1) singleton   (by default)

		2) Prototype

		3) request

		4) session


-> For singleton scoped beans only one object will be created by IOC container at the time of IOC starting (eager loading)

-> For prototype scoped beans IOC will create new object every time based on demand (lazy loading).


-> To configure bean scope we will use "scope" attribute.

	<bean id="credit" class="in.ashokit.CreditCardPayment" 
					  scope="prototype" />



===================
Assinment
===================

-> Develop Java application using Spring framework

		Read book data from keyboard and insert into db table using spring-jdbc.			  






===========
Autowiring
===========

-> We can perform dependency injection in 2 ways

		1) Manual Wiring
		2) Auto wiring

=> Manual wiring means programmer will inform to IOC which is dependent obj using ref attribute like below

	<bean id="pp" class="in.ashokit.PaymentProcessor">
		<property name="payment" ref="debit" />
	</bean>


=> Auto wiring means IOC will identify dependent object and it will perform DI.

=> In spring xml approach, by default autowiring is disabled.

=> Autowiring having 4 modes

				1) byName
				2) byType
				3) constructor
				4) no (default)
========
byName
========

-> Based on target bean variable name IOC will identify dependent bean and it will inject it.

Note: target bean variable name should match with bean id.

-> If any bean id is not matching with target bean variable name then D.I will not happen.

Note: Every bean should unique id.

	<bean id="payment" class="in.ashokit.CreditCardPayment" />
	<bean id="db" class="in.ashokit.DebitCardPayment" />

	<bean id="pp" class="in.ashokit.PaymentProcessor"
		autowire="byName" />

========
byType
========

-> Based on data type of variable IOC will identify dependent object.

-> If variable data type is interface then it will check interface implemented beans.

-> If we have more than one bean which are implementing interface then IOC will get confused to take decision. Then we will get ambuigity problem.

-> We can resolve ambiguity problem in 2 ways

			1) autowire-candidate = false

			2) primary = true		

=============
constructor
=============

Note: When we go for byName or byType then IOC will perform Setter Injection with autowiring.

-> If we want to perform Constructor Injection with Autowiring then we should configure autowire="constructor".

Note : autowire=constructor will use byType mechanism to identify dependent object.	

=====
no
=====

=> It is default value which will not perform autowiring.

============
Spring Boot
============

-> Spring Boot is an approach to develop spring based applications with less configuration.

-> Spring Boot is an extension for Spring Framework.

-> What type of apps we can develop using spring same type of apps we can develop using spring boot also.

Note: Spring boot internally using spring framework.

-> Spring Boot supports rapid application development.

=============================
Advantages with Spring Boot
============================

1) POM Starters (Simplied Maven dependencies)

	Ex : spring-boot-starter
	     spring-boot-starter-web
	     spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
	     spring-boot-starter-mail
	     spring-boot-starter-security

2) Dependency Version Conflict Solution

3) Auto Configuration

	Ex: if we add data-jpa starter, it will create cpool

	    when we run boot app, it will start IOC container

	    if we add web starter, it will deploy our app in server

	    If we add security starter, it will provide login page


4) Embedded Servers : It will provide server to run our app 

	Ex:  Tomcat, jetty, netty


5) Actuators : To monitor our application 
               (production ready features )



#####  spring boot = (spring + auto config ) - xml

===========
STS setup 
===========


Step-1 : download sts jar file using below link

https://cdn.spring.io/spring-tools/release/STS4/4.20.1.RELEASE/dist/e4.29/spring-tool-suite-4-4.20.1.RELEASE-e4.29.0-win32.win32.x86_64.self-extracting.jar

Step-2 : Run jar file using cmd

		$ java -jar <jar-name>


Step-3 : Open STS.exe file		

================================
Create Spring Boot Application
===============================

1) start.spring.io  (spring initiazr)

2) STS IDE


======================================
What is start class in spring boot ?
======================================

-> Start class is entry point for springboot application

-> Start class is also called as main class in spring boot.


===========================================
How IOC will be starting in springboot ?
============================================

=> In springboot run ( ) method will start IOC container based on pom starter.

=> run ( ) method will return ioc obj


=> If we add spring-boot-starter then it will use below class to start IOC

Class Name : AnnotationConfigApplicationContext


=> If we add spring-boot-starter-web then it will use below class to start IOC

Class Name : AnnotationConfigServletWebServerApplicationContext

=> If we add spring-boot-starter-webflux then it will use below class to start IOC

Class : AnnotationConfigReactiveWebServerApplicationContext


==================================
What is @SpringBootApplication ?
==================================

@SpringBootConfiguration : Represents java class as config class
@EnableAutoConfiguration : To load auto configurer classes
@ComponentScan : To identify spring beans available in the project



==============================================
How to represent java class as Spring Bean ?
==============================================

<bean id="udao" class="in.ashokit.UserDao" scope="prototype"/>


@Component
class UserDao{
	

}

==============================================
How component scanning will work internally ?
==============================================

=> Component scan will work based on base pakage

=> start class pkg is called as base package

=> boot will scan base pakage and its sub packages

Note : The pkg name which is starting with base pkg name is called as sub package of base package.



in.ashokit
    - Application.java
    - UserDao.java
    - ReportDao.java

in.ashokit.service

in.ashokit.security

in.ashokit.util    

com.tcs
    - UserService.java    


    in.ashokit

    com.tcs


=> We can configure more than one base package also

@SpringBootApplication
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"in.ashokit", "com.tcs"})
public class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ConfigurableApplicationContext context =
				SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
		
		int count = context.getBeanDefinitionCount();
		
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}    

==============================
What is @Bean annotation ?
=============================


=> To customize bean obj creation we will write a method with @Bean annotation like below...


@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
	
	public AppConfig() {
		System.out.println("AppConfig :: Constructor");
	}

	@Bean
	public AppSecurity createSecurityObj() {
		AppSecurity as = new AppSecurity("SHA-256");
		return as;
	}
}


=> In project we will customize bean objects for below scenarios

	 - Security Customization

	 - Data Source Customization

	 - Kafka customization

	 - Redis customization

	 - Swagger Customization




@Component

@Scope

@Configuration

@Bean

@ComponentScan


============
Autowiring
=============

@Autowired annotation 


=> We can use this annotation at 3 places

1) setter method level

2) constructor level

3) field level



@Component
public class UserService {

	@Autowired
	private UserDao dao; // field injection (reflection)

	public void getUsername(Integer id) {
		System.out.println("dependent :: "+ dao.getClass().getName());
		String name = dao.findNameById(id);
		System.out.println(name);
	}
}


1) setter method

2) Constructor

3) Field

@Autowired




package in.ashokit.service;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import in.ashokit.dao.IUserDao;

@Component
public class UserService {

	private PwdService pwdService;

	private IUserDao userDao;

	private EmailService emailService;

	@Autowired
	public void setPwdService(PwdService pwdService) {
		this.pwdService = pwdService;
	}

	@Autowired
	public void setUserDao(IUserDao userDao) {
		this.userDao = userDao;
	}

	@Autowired
	public void setEmailService(EmailService emailService) {
		this.emailService = emailService;
	}

	public void registerUser(String name, String email, String pwd) {

		// encrypt pwd
		String encryptPwd = pwdService.encryptPwd(pwd);

		// save user in db
		boolean isSaved = userDao.saveUser(name, email, encryptPwd);

		// send email
		if (isSaved) {
			boolean isSent = emailService.sendEmail(email, "Test Subject", "Test Body");
			if (isSent) {
				System.out.println("User Registration Completed...");
			}
		}
	}

}
========================================================

@Service
public class UserService {

	@Autowired
	private PwdService pwdService;

	@Autowired
	private IUserDao userDao;

	@Autowired
	private EmailService emailService;

	public void registerUser(String name, String email, String pwd) {

		// encrypt pwd
		String encryptPwd = pwdService.encryptPwd(pwd);

		// save user in db
		boolean isSaved = userDao.saveUser(name, email, encryptPwd);

		// send email
		if (isSaved) {
			boolean isSent = emailService.sendEmail(email, "Test Subject", "Test Body");
			if (isSent) {
				System.out.println("User Registration Completed...");
			}
		}
	}

}

========================================================

@Component
@Scope
@Configuration
@Bean (method level annotation)
@Autowired
@Qualifier
@Primary


@Component

@Service : Will be used at business / service layer

@Repository : Will be used in DAO layer

@Controller ====> spring web mvc + c 2 b

@RestController ==> spring web mvc + b 2 b (rest api)


===========================================
Q) @Component vs @Service  vs @Repository
===========================================


=======================
Banner in Spring Boot
=======================

=> Logo printing on the console

=> Banner having 3 modes

		1) Console (default)
		2) Log
		3) Off (banner will not print)

=> We can customize banner text using banner.txt file

		location : src/main/resources

=> We can generate banner text using below URL

		URL : https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Ashok%20IT		


=======================
Runners in Spring Boot
=======================

=> Runners will execute only one time when the application starts.

=> Runners will be executed by run ( ) method in Spring Boot.

=> In boot, we have 2 types of Runners

		1) ApplicationRunner -- run ( AppArgs args )

		2) CommandLineRunner -- run ( String[] args )

===================
 Bean Life Cycle
===================

Thread Lifecycle

Servlet Life cycle

JSP life cycle

Spring Bean life cycle.....


============================================
Bean Life Cycle with Programmatic Approach
============================================

InitializingBean - afterPropertiesSet ( )

DisposableBean - destroy ( )

------------------------------------------------

@Component
public class Car implements InitializingBean, DisposableBean {

	@Override
	public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {
		System.out.println("Car starting.....");
	}

	public void drive() {
		System.out.println("I am driving car...");
	}

	@Override
	public void destroy() throws Exception {
		System.out.println("Car stoped...");
	}

}
----------------------------------------------------

==================================
Bean Life Cycle with Annotations
==================================

@PostConstruct : To execute method after bean obj creation

@PreDestory : To execute method before destorying bean obj


-----------------------------------------------------------------
@Component
public class Motor {

	@PostConstruct
	public void m1() {
		System.out.println("Motor  - init() method");
	}

	@PreDestroy
	public void m2() {
		System.out.println("Motor - destory() method...");
	}
}

26) Setter Injection (SI)

27) Constructor Injection (CI)

28) Field Injection (FI)

29) Bean Scopes

30) Strategy Design Pattern


===============
SI vs CI vs FI 
===============

FI --> not recommended to use

		reason-1 : violating oops principles 

		reason-2 : Violating single responsibility principle

SI --> First Target obj & then dependent obj will be created.

	-> Note: Partial dependency injection supported.

CI --> First dependent obj will be created & then target obj will be created.

	 -> Note: In CI, partial dependency injection not supported.		


Note : Out of CI , SI and FI it is recommended to use CI.





SOLID OOPS Principles

S - Single responsibility principle

O - Open closed principle

L - Liskov substitution principle

I - Interface seggration principle

D - Dependency Inversion principle		



@Component -> 

@Service -> It is specialized version of Component

@Repository   -> DAO layer -> SQL Exception translation
